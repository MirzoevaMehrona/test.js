 # JavaScript Variables and Constants
 ## In Javascript there is two types of intializing variables, var and let. You can use both of them.
However, there are some differences between them.
In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data.
If you are sure that the value of a variable won't change throughout the program, it's recommended
to use const .

  ## Rules for Naming JavaScript Variables
  ## 1. Variable names must start with either a letter, an underscore _, or the dollar sign $.
  ## 2. Variable names cannot start with numbers. For example:
   - 1  let text = "Wellcome"
   - 2  let $text = "to"
   - 3  let _text = "Softclub"
