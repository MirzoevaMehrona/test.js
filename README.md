 # JavaScript Variables and Constants
 ## In Javascript there is two types of intializing variables, var and let. You can use both of them.
However, there are some differences between them.
In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data.
If you are sure that the value of a variable won't change throughout the program, it's recommended
to use const .
